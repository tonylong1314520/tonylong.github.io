After using Semantic UI, I finally understood how powerful of a tool frameworks are in software engineering. Before using semantic, all my webpages that I created were very basic
and not aesthetically pleasing like other sites. I always thought that sites online were hard coded in html and css, and I will eventually learn techniques to do so as well. Now,
I definetly learned how they did it, and how much easier it is compared to how I use to do it. 

##Why
After using semantic, I believe every software developer/engineer should use a framework. Frameworks are basically templates for every element of a webpage and can save so much time.
Additionally, using frameworks allows the programmer to develop an application that is structured. What I mean by this is, for example, semantic classes help create responsive
webpages by just putting class's on the div's rather than hard coding difficult ui's such as dropdown menus. 

##Issues
Despite how helpful ui and frameworks are, there are some cons when using it. Some issues I personally have with semantic is, with the container element, I can't change some elements 
of the webpage such as the margins and centering. Another thing that dislike when using semantic is, when I want to add a sticky footer on the bottom of my webpage, there is
no class for it. I feel like having a sticky footer is very important in styling webpages and hopefully in the future they will add in a class that does so easily. 

##My Thoughts
Personally, semantic ui is the first ui I have ever used so I am not sure how it compares to other ui's such as bootstrap, but from my experience, I feel semantic just makes my
job a lot easier. I probably won't use the 'ui container' class a lot mostly because I can't customize it, but for the other classes such as the dropdown menu's, buttons and 
grids, I will be using them a lot in the future. Overall, a software engineer should always be using some type of framework because it saves a lot of time and it can make
webpages a lot more interactive than a hardcoded html/css webpage.
