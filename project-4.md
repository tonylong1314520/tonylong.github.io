summary: A small project I was working on to utilize stacks to create a calculator.

This is a calculator I coded in java utitlizing stacks to take in a prefix or postfix notation and calculate the result. I decided to do this project because I wanted to familiarize
myself of postfix and prefix notation. The best way to learn new things would be putting it to use, and the best way to problem solve for me is to code it out so I can understand
it better.

Doing this project not only helped me understand how Stack ADT's work, it also helped me understand how recursion uses a runtime stack to output back recursive results. This project
helped me understand how my next project works (i.e. the sudoku solver).
