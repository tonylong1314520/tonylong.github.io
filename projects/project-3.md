An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.
My ALU takes in two 3-bit inputs in binary and performs different calculations based on what switches you set it to. Some operations it
can perform are adding with a carry, multiply input by 2, and xor operations.

Here are some illustrations on the functions.
