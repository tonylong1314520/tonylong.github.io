After learning about semantic ui and applying it in small test cases, I decided to try and remake some websites to better understand how powerful semantic is. Semantic was the first framework I learned and it was extremely eye opening. 
Before semantic, I was hard coding webpages with basic html/css/javascript and it was extremely hard to make a professional looking website. In this project I opted to remake
https://laulima.hawaii.edu/lum/fp/login.php.
After learning about semantic I started learning how to use react. React was very intimidating at first but after combining react with semantic I started to understand how helpful 
the react module can be. It simplified webpages, instead of using classes, we would import the element instead. It was also really cool how you can build a webpage without the 
need of an html page.
Overall, this project was a very fun and eye opening learning experience!
