After learning about semantic ui and applying it in small test cases, I decided to try and remake some websites to better understand how powerful semantic is. Semantic was the first framework I learned and it was extremely eye opening. 
Before semantic, I was hard coding webpages with basic html/css/javascript and it was extremely hard to make a professional looking website. In this project I opted to remake
https://laulima.hawaii.edu/lum/fp/login.php.
Overall, this project was very fun and eye opening learning experience!
