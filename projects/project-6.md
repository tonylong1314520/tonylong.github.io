---

Created an application to replicate ratemyprofessors while improving the experience for University of Hawaii students.
## My Contributions
I contributed to creating the mock ups for the landing page, class review page, professor review page as well as creating the Navbar. I have also helped integrate the database with the professor review page and gave many suggestions to the creation of our final application. 
## My Experiences
Personally, this project helped me grow as a team player. Every class that I had taken before this that involved programming, it was mostly doing it solo, but after doing this project with my other talented group members, it helped me realize that working in a group is a valuable experience. It helped me grow as an aspiring web developer and gave me a taste of what the real world experience would be like. This project also helped me understand github intimately, such as creating organizations, homepages, project management and coding practices.
