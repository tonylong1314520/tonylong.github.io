This is one of the very first projects I ever did regarding programming. Back in junior year I took up my first programming class, a course in web development, and I learnt how to create websites from scratch. This website was made using 'caret' a free, graphical text editor modeled on sublime text. This project taught me the very basics of programming, programming formats, and taught me many javascript methods which will help me in my ICS 314 class (hopefully).

This is my very first project for my web development class in high school. I utilized html, css and javascript to try and create an interactive hotel website which is able to take a sample credit card information and output a receipt. It also utilizes windows.alert function, which is a bit archaic, but nonetheless effective in notifying the user to know an action is done.
